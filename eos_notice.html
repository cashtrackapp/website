<h2>Important Notice!</h2>
<h3>The CashTrack service is no longer available, effective August 1, 2010.</h3>

<form><fieldset><pre>

On behalf of the CashTrack development team, I would like to thank you
for your use of the CashTrack mobile application for Android.

CashTrack started as a one semester project by 3 computer science
students at the University of Michigan in September of 2009. Since
then it has continued to evolve  into the application you use today.
Throughout the development of this application, we have received many
messages from you the users - encouragement, thanks, complaints, and
bug reports. All of these comments have been helpful and we would like
to take a moment to thank you - we couldn't have made this happen
without you.

Unfortunately, the application never gained enough popularity to
enable us to transition it to a paid service. This means that we have
not been able to offset the cost of hosting the servers that make this
application possible.

Because of this we will be discontinuing support for CashTrack on
August 1, 2010. This means that, as of 9 AM on Sunday August 1, you
will no longer be able to use the CashTrack application on your
Android phone.

In anticipation of this date, we have already removed the application
from the Android Market.

We understand that this decision adversely affects you, the loyal
users of the application. As such, we will be doing our best to assist
you in migrating your expense tracking needs to another application.

We'll do our best to answer your most common questions below.

Q: Will the debts I entered on my phone still be accessible once the
service goes offline on August 1, 2010?

A: All of the data you entered into the application was securely
stored on the CashTrack servers in a secure data center. Once the
service goes offline, you will no longer be able to directly access
that data from the server. If you are currently using CashTrack 2.0
and have checked the 'save login information' option in the settings,
then a cached copy of the data exists on your phone and may be
accessible after the service goes offline. However, if you are still
using the original version of CashTrack you will not be able to access
your data.

To assist you in recovering the data you entered into the application,
you can request a copy of all of your data from us by emailing
help@cashtrackapp.com. Please note that you must contact us from the
same email address you used to sign up for the service and you must
also provide your user name. Once we receive your request, we will
send you an excel file that contains all of your saved debts.

Q: Do I need to uninstall the application from my phone?

A: After the service goes offline, you will no longer be able to open
the application on your phone (unless you are using 2.0 and have
checked the 'save login information' box), so we suggest that you
uninstall the application to save space on your phone.

Q. I really enjoyed your application and I wish it were not going away.

A. We're happy that you enjoyed the application and are sorry that we
must shut down the service. If you feel the need to further show your
enjoyment of the application, we suggest that you make a donation to
the University of Michigan Department of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science to allow future students the opportunity to develop
for such a great platform. You can do so on the following page:
http://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/about/giving/giving.html. Make sure to
mention that you are donating to support Professor Elliot Soloway's
mobile application development course.

Q. Is there another application I can use on my Android phone that I
can replace CashTrack with?

A. While there is no single application that can fully replicate all
of the features of CashTrack, we know of a few that you may like.
Check out the applications for Mint.com (TM) and Xpenser.com (TM).

Again, thank you for your continued support of CashTrack. We sincerely
apologize that this measure is necessary. If you have any further
questions, please contact us at help@cashtrackapp.com.
